        The 5 Steps of Cognitive Restructuring (CR) is a skill for carefully examining your
        thinking when you are feeling upset or distressed about something. You can use it to deal
        with any situation in which you are experiencing negative feelings. If a close evaluation
        of your distressing thought indicates that it is not accurate, you will change it to a more
        accurate and less distressing thought. If your evaluation indicates that your distressing
        thought is accurate, then you will come up with an Action Plan to deal with the situation.
        This handout provides instructions for each of the 5 Steps of CR. Handout 28 provides a
        worksheet for using the 5 Steps of CR to address an upsetting feeling in a specific
        situation.
      </p>
      <p><strong>STEP 1: THE SITUATION</strong><br/>
        In Step 1, you write down the upsetting situation. The situation might be an actual event,
        such as going to the grocery store, or having an argument with someone, or a memory of
        an event such as thinking about the disaster. In either case, just write one sentence
        describing the situation.
      </p>
      <p><strong>STEP 2: THE FEELING</strong><br/>
        In Step 2, you want to identify the most upsetting feeling you had in the situation.
        Sometimes you may have had more than one feeling in the situation, but you should
        focus on identifying the strongest and most upsetting feeling. It is easiest to focus on
        four broad feelings:
        <ul>
          <li>fear and anxiety</li>
          <li>sadness and depression</li>
          <li>guilt and shame</li>
          <li>anger</li>
        </ul>
        Pick one of these four feelings and work through all 5 steps with this feeling. For
        example, fear might be the strongest feeling associated with going to the grocery store,
        while guilt might be the strongest feeling associated with the thought of not evacuating
        from the flood soon enough.<br/>
        If you have more than one strong feeling about a given situation, complete a CR on the
        first feeling and then a second CR on the next feeling.
      </p>
      <p><strong>STEP 3: THE THOUGHT</strong><br/>
        In Step 3, you identify your thoughts about the situation that are underlying your
        upsetting feelings. If you are unsure what those thoughts are, ask yourself the following
        questions, depending on what your upsetting feelings were:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>For fear or anxiety, ask yourself, “What bad thing do I expect to happen?” “What kind of danger am I in?”</li>
        <li>For sadness or depression, ask yourself, “What have I lost hope in?” “What is missing in my life or in me?”</li>
        <li>For guilt or shame, ask yourself, “What bad thing have I done?” “What is wrong with me?”</li>
        <li>For anger, ask yourself, “What is unfair about this situation?” “Who has wronged me?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These questions can help you identify the thoughts that are upsetting you. For example,
        anxiety about going to the grocery store might be related to the thought “I won’t be able
        to get out if someone starts shooting;” feeling guilty about not evacuating soon enough
        might be related to the thought “If I had evacuated sooner, I would have saved my
        father’s life.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Try to be as specific as possible when identifying upsetting thoughts. For example, the
        thought “There could be a shooter in the grocery store and I wouldn’t be able to get out
        alive” is more specific than the thought “Something bad might happen in the grocery
        store.” Similarly, the thought “If I had evacuated sooner, I would have been able to save
        my father’s life” is more specific than the thought “I am a bad person.”
      </p>
      <p>
        You may have several upsetting thoughts related to the situation. The following questions
        may help you identify other upsetting thoughts about the situation:
        <ul>
          <li>What would it mean to you if XX happened?</li>
          <li>If XX happened, what would happen then?</li>
          <li>What would be so bad about XX happening?</li>
        </ul>
        Write down all the upsetting thoughts about the situation on the worksheet that you can
        think of. When you are done, go through each thought and choose the one that is most
        upsetting or distressing to you. Circle the thought on the worksheet—that is the thought
        you will be working on for the remaining steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        After identifying your most upsetting thought, consider whether it might be one of the
        Problematic Thinking Styles listed on the worksheet. That is, ask yourself whether your
        thought might be a common but inaccurate way of reaching conclusions in a situation.
        For example, the thought “There could be a shooter in the grocery store and I wouldn’t be
        able to get out alive” might be an example of the Overestimating Risk thinking style. If
        you think your thought may be one (or more) of the Problematic Thinking Styles listed,
        circle which ones on the worksheet. If not or you are unsure, you don’t have to circle any
        of them.
      </p>
      <p><strong>STEP 4: EVALUATE THE THOUGHT</strong><br/>
        In Step 4 you want to evaluate the accuracy of your upsetting thought as carefully and
        objectively as possible. To do this, first think of all of the evidence you can that supports
        your thought or makes you think it is accurate. For example, for the thought “There could
        be a shooter in the grocery store and I wouldn’t be able to get out alive” the person could
        ask, “Why do I think there will be a shooter in the grocery store?” and “If there was a
        shooter there, why do I think I wouldn’t be able to get out alive?” Write all the evidence
        down on the worksheet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, think of all the evidence you can that does not support your thought, or suggests it
        may not be accurate. Consider as many reasons as you can for why your thought might
        not be correct. Then, write all the evidence against the thought down on the worksheet.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way of helping you come up with evidence against the thought is to go back to Step
        3 and examine whether you decided that the thought might be a Problematic Thinking
        Style. If you did, and you circled one or more of the specific Problematic Thinking
        Styles, then it means that you believe the thought may be inaccurate, and you can ask
        yourself why you believed that. For example, if the person identifying the thought in Step
        3 about the shooter (“There could be a shooter in the grocery store and I wouldn’t be able
        to get out alive”) indicated that it was an example of the Overestimating Risk thinking
        style, they could ask themselves “Does thinking that a shooter could be in the grocery
        store overestimate the real chances of such a thing occurring?” and “Realistically, what
        are the chances that a shooter will show up at the grocery store when I go shopping?”
        Answers to these questions are evidence against the thought being accurate, and should
        be recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way of identifying evidence that does not support the thought is to ask yourself
        questions that may help you look at the situation and your thought differently. Some good
        questions to ask are:
        <ol>
          <li>Is there another way of looking at the situation?</li>
          <li>Is there an alternative explanation for what happened?</li>
          <li>How would someone else think about the situation?</li>
          <li>Is my concern based more on how I feel than the actual facts in the situation?</li>
          <li>Am I placing unrealistic and unobtainable standards on myself that I would never
          expect other people to achieve?</li>
          <li>Am I overestimating how much control and responsibility I have in this
          situation?</li>
          <li>What would be the worst thing that could happen if my fear were true?</li>
          <li>Am I not considering everything I can do to deal with the problem or situation?</li>
          <li>Am I thinking that because a low-probability event happened to me, that it is
          very likely to happen again to me?</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example of coming up with all the evidence for and against a thought, the person
        evaluating the thought “There could be a shooter in the grocery store and I wouldn’t be
        able to get out alive” might list the following evidence supporting the accuracy of the
        thought:
        <ul>
          <li>Shootings can happen in public places.</li>
          <li>I was afraid.</li>
          <li>There was a man wearing a backpack in the store which could have had a weapon.</li>
          <li>If a shooting happened it would be hard to get to the exit without drawing attention
          to myself.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The person might then list the following evidence against the thought:
        <ul>
          <li>I have been to the grocery store many times and nothing bad has happened.</li>
          <li>I feel afraid in a lot of situations where nothing bad happens.</li>
          <li>Carrying a backpack doesn’t mean the man had a gun.</li>
          <li>Mass shootings in public places like grocery stores occur very rarely, and such an
          event is very unlikely to happen.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p><strong>STEP 5: MAKE A DECISION</strong><br/>
        Step 5 involves making a decision about whether your thought is accurate or not, based
        on all the evidence you have listed in Step 4, and then taking action based on your
        decision. When considering the evidence for and against the accuracy of your thought,
        you should place the greatest weight on strong evidence that is objective and based on
        facts, and give less attention to weak evidence that is based only on feelings or beliefs.
        Being objective when evaluating your thought is important, since you want your
        understanding of the situation to be as accurate as possible so that any actions you take
        are informed and effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        When trying to be objective, you can think of yourself like a scientist who is evaluating
        the evidence supporting the effectiveness of a new treatment and is primarily interested in
        objective facts. Or you can think of yourself like a lawyer, presenting the evidence for or
        against a case to an impartial jury, based on the facts. You can also ask yourself whether
        you could convince another person that the thought is true (or false).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, after weighing the evidence for and against the thought that the person
        might encounter a shooter at the grocery store (“There could be a shooter in the grocery
        store and I wouldn’t be able to get out alive”), the person decided that the thought was
        not supported by the evidence and was inaccurate. The strongest pieces of evidence
        against the thought were the fact that the person had been to the grocery store many times
        before and nothing happened, lots of people wear backpacks that don’t carry guns, and
        mass shootings in public places are very rare.
      </p>
      <p>
        After deciding whether the thought is accurate or not (and checking the designated box
        on the worksheet), you then take action, depending on your decision. If you concluded
        that the evidence does not support the thought, then you come up with a new and more
        accurate thought to replace your old inaccurate thought. This new thought is recorded on
        the worksheet. New and more accurate thoughts are almost always associated with a
        reduction in distress compared to the original, inaccurate thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the person who concluded that their thought about encountering a shooter at
        the grocery store was inaccurate came up with the following more accurate thought:
        “Even though I feel anxious when I go to the grocery store, it is very unlikely that there
        will be a shooting. It is safe for me to shop there.” This new thought was written down on
        the worksheet
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if you concluded that the evidence does support the thought, and
        therefore that the thought is accurate, it means that you have a good reason for feeling
        upset about the situation. In this case, taking action involves developing an Action Plan
        for dealing with the upsetting situation, and changing it somehow. An Action Plan can be
        developed with the help of a separate worksheet (see Handout 29), which breaks the
        planning down into four steps: 1) define the problem, 2) brainstorm possible solutions
        and select the best one(s), 3) make a plan to implement the selected solution(s), 4) follow
        the plan and set a time to follow up on whether it was implemented successfully.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some situations, you might first go through the 5 Steps of CR and conclude that an upsetting
        thought was inaccurate, and then come up with a new and more accurate thought which is less
        upsetting, but which is nevertheless still somewhat distressing. In this case, you can then develop
        an Action Plan to deal with the distressing situation. Thus, in some situations you may need to
        both correct inaccurate thinking to make it more accurate and create an Action Plan to address a
        genuine problem.

        <p><strong>Guidance:</strong> List the evidence FOR and AGAINST your thought.
            <ul>
              <li>Ask: “Is there another way of looking at this situation?”</li>

              <li>“I've been to the store many times; nothing bad happened.”</li>
              <li>“Feeling afraid doesn't mean it’s actually dangerous.”</li>
